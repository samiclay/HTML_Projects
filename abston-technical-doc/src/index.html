      In building this site as a challenge on my way to the freecodecamp certification, I followed a few steps. These are the same steps I used when designing the three before this one. I will likely use the same method when I make the next one. If I separate out the steps, they would be as described in this list. I will go into detail about each step. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Goals
      </li>
      <li>
        Content Frame
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS
      </li>
      <li>
        Media Query
      </li>
      <li>
        Test and Complete
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I will not be going into detail about how I test the requirements of the site. It is truly very simple. Code.io has javascript set up with a test suite and it is as simple as pressing a few buttons. I will however be specific about about the first four. 
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Goals">
    <header>
      <h2>
        Goals
      </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      This doesn't seem like a super important step because it does not include any coding. It is however the most important one. When I attack a challenge like this, it's important for me to know all the requirements of the challenge in order to pass. You could do them one at a time, but I have reason for seeing them all at the same time.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, as in this challenge, difference requirements will be fulfilled the same way. For example, with this site, they want the layout of the CSS to change if the screen is bigger or smaller. They also want a media query. These can both be achieved using the same group of code. I will be using the media query to resolve the screen issue. 
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Content_Framework">
    <header>
      <h2>
        Content Framework
      </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      My next step is to create what I like to call a frame for the site. It uses simple text content and pictures as needed. When I figure out what I plan on writing out in the actual page, as in the finished project, then I can simply put that in in place of the placeholder text I make. Before typing these paragraphs, I had filler text in here such as "filler". It looked like this:
    </p>
    <code>
      &ltp&gt
        filler
      &lt/p&gt
    </code>
    <p>
      And the HTML code that created that snippet of code showed: 
    </p>
    <code>
      &ltcode&gt
        Code Here
      &lt/code&gt
    </code>
    <p>
      Now imagine that for 10 p tags and 5 code tags and 5 li's. As well as all the other header and nav requirements. 
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="CSS">
    <header>
      <h2>
        CSS
      </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      After creating my framework, I happened to write the actual content, but I didn't have to yet. That is a "step" that I can do at any time without affecting the page that much. Then, after the framework, I would design the visual aspects of the page. This means designing the boxes, the colors, placing all the elements inside the boxes and making sure everything is the right size and looks good. 
    </p>
    <p>
 As I mentioned, while typing this out, I have not yet created the CSS to make it look pretty, however I do have preliminary styles ready to be filled in. When I fill them in, I will do as stated above with the boxes the colors and the positioning. This takes a little longer because I have to fiddle with it. 
    </p>
    <code>
      Code Here
    </code>

  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Media_Query">
    <header>
      <h2>
        Media Query
      </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      After I finish the preliminary CSS, the next step is to change the CSS when the screen is large enough. I have a media query prepared for this purpose. So, when the screen size is large enough, the CSS layout will change completely. Once this media query is complete, all that is left is to test and fix any problems with the site.
